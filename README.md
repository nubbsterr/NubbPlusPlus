# What is Nubb++? 
Nubb++ is just a small language built on BASIC, with a teeny bit of python/C++ syntax to bring a modern twist
to an otherwise teeny tiny language.

Nubb++ is made for simple logic and basic programming, it supports logical operators, basic arithmetic, functions, arrays,
FOR/WHILE loops, IF/ELIF/ELSE statements, static types, and much more. 

All such features can be found in the [changelog](changelog.txt).
NOTE: This project was primarly built on top of Austin Henley's Teeny Tiny compiler, which can be found [here](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html). Huge props to this genius :)

# Can we code in Nubb++? üî•
As of 08/13, Nubb++ is released in its 1.0 state! The compiler features mainly basic components like user input, conditional logic, print statements, etc. More features can be found under the [changelog](changelog.txt).

If you guys have any questions or concerns with Nubb++, feel free to make a PR or DM me on discord @ nubbieeee :)

Please note that the Nubb++ compiler is compiled in Debug mode using CMake. I initially wanted to compile with Release mode, but performance right now is good enough anyways. So unless it becomes a problem, I'll be sticking with it for now :P

# Nubb++ Examples üìù
Nubb++ has a dedicated folder of [examples](Nubb++Examples) to help you get a hang of learning the language :)
Some examples are missing since this feature was implemented late into development, though most examples will already be 
deprecated given syntax changes to the language.

For more info, check out the [changelog](changelog.txt).
For the latest code snippet, see [code.nubb++](code.nubb++).
