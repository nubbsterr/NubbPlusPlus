# Nubb++ 
My very own custom language (BASIC dialect) and compiler built in C++.

# What is Nubb++? 
Nubb++ is just a dummy language based on BASIC. 
I wanted to make something wicked with C++ and came to the conlusion that a compiler would be fit for that task.

# Can we code in Nubb++? ðŸ”¥
As of 08/12, the compiler is nearly finished. The emitter (compiler component that creates executable) is nearly done!

I'll hopefully have the project finished by the end of the week. But please feel free to test and tinker with 
the compiler yourself!
