# Nubb++ 
My very own custom language (BASIC dialect) and compiler built in C++.

# What is Nubb++? 
Nubb++ is just a dummy language based on BASIC, with a teeny bit of python/C++ syntax.
I wanted to make something wicked with C++ as my first project and came to the conclusion that a compiler would be fit for that task.

# Can we code in Nubb++? ðŸ”¥
As of 08/13, Nubb++ is released in its 1.0 state! The compiler features mainly basic components like user input, conditional logic, print statements, etc. More features can be found under the changelog.txt file!

If you guys have any questions or concerns with Nubb++, feel free to make a PR or DM me on discord @ nubbieeee :)

Please note that the Nubb++ compiler is compiled in Debug mode using C++. I initially wanted to compile with Release mode, but performance right now is good enough anyways. So unless it becomes a problem, I'll be sticking with it for now :P
