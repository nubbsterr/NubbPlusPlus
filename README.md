# Nubb++ 
My very own custom language (BASIC dialect) and compiler built in C++.

# What is Nubb++? 
Nubb++ is just a dummy language based on BASIC. 
I wanted to make something wicked with C++ and came to the conlusion that a compiler would be very cool.

# Can we code in Nubb++? ðŸ”¥
The compiler is nowhere near done, but you are free to make changes to it and test it yourself through the files on this repo.
